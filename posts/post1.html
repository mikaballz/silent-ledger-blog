    <h3> Thesis Topic:</h3> 
        <p>Anger is something everyone feels, but people show it in different ways. Write an essay explaining. What makes you angry and how it affects how you feel and your relationships. If you have more causes, write a focus-on-causes essay with one effect. If you have more effects, write a focus-on-effects essay with one cause.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Anger is a fundamental emotion felt by all humans in order to get a grasp of their boundaries and personal bearings. However, when this is left unchecked, it can consume a person and negatively affect their emotions and relationships. Throughout my life, anger has always been a major part of it, whether that is viewed as a negative or positive trait. It is difficult to open my eyes to the world every morning when the singular emotion I consistently feel is anger–what people commonly refer to as  ‘waking up on the wrong side of the bed’. The thing about human beings is that they feel anger at least once a day (MentalHealth.com, 2024), yet they view it as something to be eradicated from their lives. </p>
        <p>It is seen as a destructive weapon and force that brings harm to not only others but also oneself. Because of this, anger is constantly portrayed as a negative trait, regarded as a major disgrace in a person’s character.</p>
        
        <p>One thing that truly angers me from the depths of my core is being ‘too busy’ to ever notice the current circumstances at hand. Every time I happen to be overwhelmed with tasks, life strikes me head-on, and I fail to recognize its effects until the consequences come showering down upon me. As a result, anger has filled me with guilt, grief–emotions that have had a huge burden of regret that have taken a toll on my relationships with others, and even with myself. Someone once told me, “Holding onto anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned” (Park, 2022). As someone growing up in a household filled with anger, I assumed that this emotion was incredibly common within others’ lives. I was clearly very wrong.</p>
        
        <p>My relationships with different people have come down and suffered at various points, even when I never intended them to. I believe that the main reason relationships between friends, lovers, and family are easily broken down is due to anger and failure to see the situation clearly, leading them to lash out in one way or another. Anger consumes people, and when consumed by anger, the only thought in one’s mind is throwing the coal at someone else–only to fatally realize that they have already burnt themselves in the process.</p>
        
        <p>I absolutely dislike the thought of losing opportunities that are on the table–whether big or small–simply because I happened to be too busy to ever notice them. It could be based on academics, personal, or maybe a fleeting moment of connection with someone dear to oneself.</p>
        
        <p>The mere idea of losing something because I was too preoccupied to notice makes me fume in anger and fills me with frustration. I find myself constantly grabbing the burning coal, throwing it at others, believing that the lost opportunities are solely not my fault, but also because of others. I was completely drunk with the idea that being angry, or the mere act of anger should be imposed on everyone around me, because that is how I was raised to release anger. But at the end of the day, when everything becomes clear, guilt eats me up more than anything. I regret the actions and words that I have directed at people I truly value and care about.

Not only have I lost important opportunities, but I have also lost parts of myself and those around me because I failed to see through the reality in front of me.</p>
        
        <p>Because of the anger that is constantly present in my life, I have tried my hardest to sober up to this emotion, and it has definitely gotten better. It is important to realize that anger can be beneficial to you in some form or another because it can shift unpleasant circumstances to brand new opportunities. It pushes a person to seek change and transform for growth. Meditation, although overlooked and regarded as ‘useless’, has completely transformed my life in the best way possible.</p>
        
        <p>Sobering up or letting go of anger is certainly not easy, and it definitely takes time, but the way it can help you grow as a person, whilst mending your relationship with others is extremely important and beneficial for personal growth. Another method I particularly use that aims to mend relationships and connections is Mindful Communication (Sigma Assessment Systems, n.d.). Mindful Communication involves learning to communicate calmly with a clear mind while being aware of your current emotions and how they influence the conversation. With this, you can ask yourself formative questions like, “Why am I angry or feeling this way?”. This way, you can quickly recognize the cause of your anger and understand why you feel a certain way.</p>
        
        <p>Yes, it is difficult to deal with anger, especially when it disrupts your own way of living, but acknowledging the methods is only the first step; without implementing them, the knowledge you have gained remains ineffective and useless. The thing is, anger definitely has its way of clinging to us, clawing at our backs, and weighing us down with guilt and regret–but true growth begins when we finally let go of the burning coal.</p>
