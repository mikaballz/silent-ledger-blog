      <h2>Refuge Passing</h2>
      <p class="post-subtitle">a short poem</p>
      <p><em>Wrote on: November 21, 2025 date </em></p>
      <img src="../images/frankenstein.jpg" alt="Genghis Khan Image"> 
    
        <p>For how much longer can I drown here down?
In the oceans of classes and lakes of crowds,
The toil of work and hype of shows clouds the clouds,
My senses raped and left full with but a frown.</p>
          <p>Everything sits, sounds, and moves without a break!
By endless chatter I am shoved unto rage—
More by rapid sophists and dancers onstage,
Who play morals and art into the show fake.</p>
          <p>Yet for just once I escape the people’s sea,
And a silent call comes from the coddling trees,
Joined by the swaying grass and its spirit’s breeze,
Gracing Eden’s calm to me, small yet free.</p>
          <p>I watch follies of work and play pass with time,
While my wisdom of sight knows not a measure.
A thought feeds me: What must be with this leisure,
Unchained as beasts and alone as gods sublime?</p>
            <p>But before any thought of a true work of art,
Nature, part of campus, shows them close again!
The onslaught of the eventful noise of men!
Now I am left with no refuge but the heart.</p>
